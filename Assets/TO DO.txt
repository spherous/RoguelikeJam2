Post jam desired changes:
    Enemy death animation/SFX
    Object pooling for performance
    Fully tested levels & balanced levels
    Buff cannon
    bugfix with moving web towers should destroy old webs and make new after the moves
    bugfix with removing a buildable tile using the wrong tile texture
    Add hijacker
    Add attack animation to black knight when he hits the kingdom
    Add animation to spawn point and kingdom gate (home point)
    Enemy take damage noise
    Audio pooling so we stop overlapping so many different sounds
    Turn cards gray or red when the player doesn't have enough threads to play it, prevent them from dragging it off hand.
    Turn web mod cards gray or red when the player doesn't have any web towers to play them on
    Turn chain mods gray or red when the player doesn't have any chain towers to play them on
    Don't allow player to play web mods on non-web towers
    don't allow players to play chain mods on non-chaining towers
    Give cannon small splash effect on impact
    Ignite webs
    Ignite debuff card
    DoT buff cards
    Indicator of how many waves are left in current level
    Enemies that are going too fast can get stuck, possibly soft locking the game if the player can't damage them
    range indicator should include buffs
    need more interesting generation happening for opening decks, getting rng'd out sucks.
    Card picks should be weighted and by category for level rewards. Should not be able to generate 2 of the same type of card or even a duplicate.
    aoe and cannon towers need more interesting things happening
    Threads need explained better, and there needs to be an indicator for sustained buffs from threads and on completion actions.
    Indicate when a card gets trashed vs discarded
    show deck, discard, and trash pile
    AOE tower needs a vfx
